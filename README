config.sh is main script, hpss.sh is script to archive on hpss
${machine}_preamble is job scheduler preamble for config.sh
${machine}_preamble_hpss is job scheduler preamble for hpss.sh
submit_job.sh <machine> submits config.sh (which then submits itself and hpss.sh).
All of these plus checkdates.py must live in expthome, rest in enkfscripts
most model namelist parameters set in run_fv3*.sh, some in config.sh.
most of GSI namelist parameters set in run_gsi_4denvar.sh, some in config.sh.
most of EnKF namelist parameters set in config.sh, some in enkf_run.sh.
Resolution specific processor layout stuff for FV3 is set in <machine>_preamble.

To cold start, create an initial directory in the experiment directory (i.e <expthome>/2000010100)
touch an empty file (touch <expthome>/2000010100/cold_start_bias).  This will tell the scripts
that there is no initial bias correction file.  Copy the dummy files gdas1.t00z.abias and abias_pc
from this directory to <expthome>/2000010100.  Copy the initial conditions files to 2000010100.
Create analdate.csh and fg_only.csh in the top level experiment directory (<expthome>).
fg_only should contain "setenv fg_only true" and analdate.csh should contain
"setenv analdate 2000010100" and "setenv analdate_end YYYYMMDDHH", where YYYYMMDDHH is the
date you want the experiment to end.
